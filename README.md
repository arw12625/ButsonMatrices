# Butson Matrices

This Mathematica code attempts to find Complex Hadamard Matrices of the Butson Type in hopes of finding a new family of matrices. The current approach consists of selectively finding a set of mutually orthogonal vectors using a clique finding algorithm.

This code was developed as a research project at UTK in the summer of 2015 but is still under development.
